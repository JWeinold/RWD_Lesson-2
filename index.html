    <h2 class="heading">Responsive Web Design -- Why is it Important?</h2>
      <p> Have you ever had  a bit of extra time riding the bus home after work or waiting in a line for a movie?  In yesterday’s world you would just look out the window of the bus or talk with a friend in line.  However, with today’s technology and the popularity of smartphones, folks are using this time to research a topic, check bank accounts or even purchase a favorite book, movie or a cool shirt!
      </p>
      <p> If you are in the business of selling products online, this spare time could mean new purchases and profit.  Therefore, it is very important for your business to ensure that your site is equally if not more functional from a smartphone then from a computer’s browser and your future purchaser can easily browse your product line and make purchases securely  If your website was not built for this type of access, you can quickly use sales and minimize profit.

          In order to meet mobile requirements, you need to think mobile first, design and build your website first with access from a mobile device first, the smallest viewpoint.  Then complete your development adding larger displays, up to browser display from a computer.   There are several technical approaches to make this happen, however, currently the most popular and efficient method is called Responsive Web Design.   Responsive Web Design is the practice of designing using a mix of flexible   grids and layouts and CSS to allow your web site to respond to the size of the screen or web browser.
